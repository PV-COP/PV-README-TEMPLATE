Note for school project: this may be the only thing someone visiting your page reads. Try to make a great impression. Make someone want to hire you. This section will also be useful to you in the future to remind you about the project. 

## Demonstration

Add an animated gif of your program running. You can use ShareX, GIPHY Capture or another tool. https://blog.github.com/2018-06-29-GIF-that-keeps-on-GIFing/
Note for school project: This is a great way for friends and family to easily see your project in action. 
The markdown is  \!\[Alt text\]\(relative/path/to/img.png) <br />

## Documentation

For Python, use the output of your docstrings. For other languages, create a docs folder in your project. If using Java, generate JavaDoc in your IDE. If using C++, use Doxygen. Change repository settings (using Settings at top of page) to use GitHub Pages with your docs folder. Add a link to the javadoc/doxygen index.html file with this markdown: \[Text to appear]\(URL) <br />
The URL will be YourGitHubUserName.github.io/YourRepositoryName/foldername/filename<br /> 
Do not include the docs folder name in your URL. <br />
Sample: \[JavaDoc]\(https://pv-cop.github.io/PV-README-TEMPLATE/javadoc/index.html) <br /> <br />
[JavaDoc](https://pv-cop.github.io/PV-README-TEMPLATE/javadoc/index.html)

## Diagrams

Such as a class diagram. <br /> 
The markdown is  \!\[Alt text\]\(relative/path/to/img.png) <br />
For example, this image 9919.png is saved to the docs folder in my repository and the markdown is  \!\[Sample Image\](docs/9919.png) <br />

## Getting Started

Instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on someone's local machine for development and testing purposes.
<br />
Note for real project: You want to be able to share your project and enable collaboration. 
<br />
Note for school project: You want a potential client or hirer to be able to run your program. 

## Built With

* IDE used  
* Other software used  
* Resources used  
<br />Note for school project: Every section is an opportunity to make an impression. You could briefly add what you know about the IDE and describe your development skills. 

## Contributing

This section is more important for real projects but is good to include in school projects. <br />
One of the main purposes of GitHub and similar services is to provide a means for project collaboration. <br />
Tell someone how they can contribute to this project.

## Key Programming Concepts Utilized

This section would not necessarily be in a real README.  <br />
It is a reference for you and a place to impress potential employers with your knowledge. 
Identify what concepts you utilize so when you need to use them again you will know that you will find them here. Include a brief description of the concepts in your own words to help you prepare for related interview questions.
