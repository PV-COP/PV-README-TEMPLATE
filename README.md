# Prof. Vanselow's README Template

A guide for creating a README for a student project. The template in this repository aims to identify and combine README best practices for real projects and for student projects. These are just suggestions, not requirements.     

## Getting Started

Start with the TemplateWithInfo then copy the TitleOnlyTemplate.   

## Software

You can create and edit markdown files in any text editor or right within GitHub.com. 
Many IDEs have support for editing markdown files or plugins that can be added to them.
https://stackedit.io/app# is a nice online option.
QOwnNotes is a solid standalone option. https://www.qownnotes.org/
